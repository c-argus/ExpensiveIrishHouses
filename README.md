# "Expensive Irish Houses" Finances app

## About
This app was inspired by my own experience of trying to save money to achieve the goal of buying a house. It can be used for anyone who wants to save some money.
With a clean visual the user will be able to see, delete in form of a list all the transactions that were saved. As well as checking the most recent balance.
